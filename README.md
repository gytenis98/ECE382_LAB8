##Overview

During this lab, you will combine the previous laboratory assignments and program your robot to autonomously navigate through a maze. On the last day of the lab, each section will hold a competition to see who can solve the maze the fastest. The fastest time in ECE 382 will have their name engraved on a plaque in the CSD lab. Believe it or not, the main goal of this lab is for you to have some fun with computer engineering!

##Requirements

1. Your robot must always start at the home position.
2. Your robot is considered successful only if it finds one of the three exits and moves partially out of the maze.
3. A large portion of your grade depends on which door you exit.
+ 1.Door Required Functionality
+ 2 Door 2 - B Functionality
+ 3 Door 3 - A Functionality1.You cannot hit a wall!
+ 4 Bonus! Navigate from the A door back to the entrance using the same algorithm.1.You cannot hit a wall!


4. Your robot must solve the maze in less than three minutes.
5. Your robot will be stopped if it touches the wall more than twice.
6. Your robot must use the IR sensors to find its path through the maze.



###Prelab

I used the same hardware from last lab.
